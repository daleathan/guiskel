guiskel -- Skeletons for Python gui applications

You'd like to create a new desktop GUI app, but you're not sure what toolkit to pick? With guiskel,
you can fool around with pre-created toy projects in every GUI toolkit supported by Python.

HOW TO USE

1. Install Python 3.2+
2. Install project-dependant dependencies.
3. Run "python build.py <sub-project name>"
4. Run "python run.py"

DEPENDENCIES

qt:
 - PyQt 4.8+ from http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/
cocoa:
 - XCode 4
 - ObjP from http://bitbucket.org/hsoft/objp
tk:
 - None

NOTES

These skeleton projects follow a design pattern I called "cross-toolkit development" and I talk
about in in my article at http://www.hardcoded.net/articles/cross-toolkit-software.htm . You might
want to read about it.

I lied to you, it's not all GUI supported by Python that are included here, just a few, but that's
because I don't know them all! Please, feel free to contribute your own skeleton project! Repository
is at http://bitbucket.org/hsoft/guiskel
